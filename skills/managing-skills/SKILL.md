# Managing Claude Code Skills

Create, update, and improve Claude Code skills following best practices.

## When to Use

Automatically invoke when the user:
- Asks to "create a skill" or "make a skill"
- Wants to "update a skill" or "improve a skill"
- Requests "skill template" or "SKILL.md help"
- Needs to "review a skill" or "check skill quality"

## What Are Skills?

**Skills** are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality. Key characteristics:
- **Model-invoked**: Claude autonomously decides when to use them
- **Progressive disclosure**: Core instructions + on-demand resources
- Required `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter
- Optional supporting files (reference.md, examples.md, etc.)

## Quick Reference

### File Structure

| File | Required | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | ✓ | Core instructions (<500 lines) |
| `scripts/` | | Executable automation (Python/Bash) |
| `references/` | | Documentation loaded on-demand |
| `assets/` | | Output files (templates, images) |
| `templates/` | | Reusable boilerplate |

### Minimal Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: [What it does]. Use when [triggers].
---

# Skill Title

Brief overview.

## When to Use
- [Trigger scenario 1]
- [Trigger scenario 2]

## Workflow

### Step 1: [Action]
Instructions with checklists if needed.

### Step 2: [Action]
Include validation: run → check → fix → repeat.

## Notes
- Constraints and prerequisites
```

## Storage Locations

| Location | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `~/.claude/skills/` | Personal, not shared |
| `.claude/skills/` | Project-level, git tracked |
| `plugin/skills/` | Plugin distribution |

## Workflow: Creating Skills

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

1. **Purpose**: What should this skill do?
2. **Triggers**: What phrases activate it?
3. **Scope**: ONE focused capability?
4. **Complexity**: Needs supporting files?

### Step 2: Naming

**Convention**: Gerund form (verb + -ing)

| Valid | Invalid |
|-------|---------|
| `processing-pdfs` | `PDF-Processor` |
| `analyzing-data` | `helper` |

Rules: lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars

### Step 3: Description (CRITICAL)

**Template**: `[What it does]. Use when [conditions/triggers].`

**Requirements**:
- Max 1024 characters
- Third person voice
- Include WHAT (capability) and WHEN (triggers)
- Specific terminology

**Good**:
```yaml
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs.
```

**Bad**:
```yaml
description: Helps with documents  # Too vague
```

See [reference.md](reference.md#description-field) for rich format with examples.

### Step 4: Write SKILL.md Body

**Target**: Under 500 lines. Challenge every sentence.

**Structure**:
1. Overview (1-2 paragraphs)
2. When to Use (trigger scenarios)
3. Workflow (numbered steps)
4. Notes (constraints)
5. Related Resources (links)

**Key rule**: Keep references one level deep.

### Step 5: Supporting Files

| File | When to Create |
|------|----------------|
| reference.md | API specs, full checklists |
| examples.md | Multiple use cases with I/O |
| best-practices.md | Advanced patterns |
| scripts/ | Utility scripts (chmod +x) |
| templates/ | Reusable boilerplate |

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for progressive disclosure details.

### Step 6: Tool Restrictions (Optional)

```yaml
---
name: code-analyzer
description: ...
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

| Type | Tools |
|------|-------|
| Read-only | Read, Grep, Glob |
| Safe ops | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash(git:*) |
| Full (default) | Omit field |

### Step 7: Create Files

**Option A: Use init script (recommended)**

```bash
./scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path .claude/skills
```

Creates complete skill structure with templates.

**Option B: Manual creation**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/skill-name
cat > .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: skill-name
description: [description]
---

# Title
...
EOF
```

### Step 8: Validate

**Run validation script:**

```bash
./scripts/quick_validate.py .claude/skills/skill-name
```

**Manual checklist:**

- [ ] Name: gerund form, lowercase, max 64 chars
- [ ] Description: specific triggers, third person, max 1024 chars
- [ ] SKILL.md: under 500 lines
- [ ] Frontmatter: valid YAML (spaces, not tabs)
- [ ] References: one level deep
- [ ] Paths: forward slashes only

See [reference.md](reference.md#validation-checklist) for complete checklist.

### Step 9: Review

Run `claude-config-reviewer` agent to validate:
- Structure and required sections
- Anti-patterns (temporary markers, broken links)
- File size limits

### Step 10: Test

1. Test activation with trigger phrases
2. Follow workflow step-by-step
3. Test across models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)
4. Iterate based on observations

See [best-practices.md](best-practices.md#testing) for testing strategies.

## Workflow: Updating Skills

### Step 1: Review Current State

```bash
cat .claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
ls .claude/skills/skill-name/
```

### Step 2: Identify Issues

Common problems:
- Vague description, missing triggers
- Outdated examples
- SKILL.md over 500 lines
- Poor structure

### Step 3: Apply Changes

Same principles as creating:
- Keep under 500 lines
- Update triggers in description
- Move extensive content to supporting files

### Step 4: Review

Run `claude-config-reviewer` agent to validate changes.

### Step 5: Test

- Test activation with various phrases
- Test across models
- Get team feedback

See [updating-skills.md](updating-skills.md) for detailed workflow.

## Key Principles

### 1. Conciseness
Under 500 lines. Assume Claude has foundational knowledge.

### 2. Degrees of Freedom
Match specificity to task fragility:
- **High**: Text instructions (flexible)
- **Medium**: Pseudocode (guided)
- **Low**: Exact scripts (deterministic)

### 3. One Level Deep
SKILL.md → supporting file (no further chaining)

### 4. Consistent Terminology
One term per concept throughout.

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Too many options | Provide defaults |
| Vague naming | Specific gerund form |
| Windows paths | Forward slashes only |
| Deep references | One level from SKILL.md |
| Skills too broad | Split into focused skills |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Never activates | Add user phrasing to description |
| Ignores content | Add TOC, improve structure |
| Conflicts with other skills | Use distinct terminology |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Generating Skill: [name]

- Name: skill-name
- Description: [description]
- Location: [path]
- Size: ~[X] lines

## Structure

- `SKILL.md` (required)
- `reference.md` (optional)
- `examples.md` (optional)

## Next Steps

1. Review and confirm
2. Create files
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Test with trigger phrases
```

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/init_skill.py` | Create new skill from template |
| `scripts/quick_validate.py` | Validate skill structure |
| `scripts/package_skill.py` | Package skill for distribution |

```bash
# Initialize new skill
./scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path .claude/skills

# Validate existing skill
./scripts/quick_validate.py .claude/skills/my-skill

# Package for distribution
./scripts/package_skill.py .claude/skills/my-skill ./dist
```

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Always use forward slashes
- Restart Claude Code after changes
- Test across multiple models
