# Output Patterns

Patterns for producing consistent, high-quality output.

Source: https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator

## Template Pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match strictness to your needs.

### For strict requirements (API responses, data formats)

```markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```

### For flexible guidance (when adaptation is useful)

```markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment:

# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[Overview]

## Key findings
[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations
[Tailor to the specific context]

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
```

## Examples Pattern

For skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs:

```markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
```

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.

## When to Use Each

| Pattern | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Strict template** | API responses, formal reports, structured data |
| **Flexible template** | Creative content, analysis, recommendations |
| **Examples** | Commit messages, code style, formatting conventions |
