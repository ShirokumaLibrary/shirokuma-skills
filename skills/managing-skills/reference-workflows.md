# Workflow Patterns

Patterns for structuring skill workflows effectively.

Source: https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator

## Sequential Workflows

For complex tasks, break operations into clear, sequential steps:

```markdown
Filling a PDF form involves these steps:

1. Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
2. Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
3. Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
4. Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
5. Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

## Conditional Workflows

For tasks with branching logic, guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
1. Determine the modification type:
   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow: [steps]
3. Editing workflow: [steps]
```

## Progressive Disclosure Patterns

Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split content into separate files when needed.

### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

```markdown
# PDF Processing

## Quick start
Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]

## Advanced features
- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
```

Claude loads FORMS.md or REFERENCE.md only when needed.

### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

```
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

When a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.

### Pattern 3: Framework/variant organization

```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
```

### Pattern 4: Conditional details

```markdown
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents
Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents
For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

## Guidelines

- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep one level deep from SKILL.md
- **Structure longer files** - For files >100 lines, include a table of contents
