## Example Report

```markdown
# Security Review Report

**Date**: 2025-11-28 14:30
**Reviewer**: Claude (reviewer agent)
**Target**: apps/admin/lib/actions/
**Role**: security

## Summary

Reviewed 5 Server Action files. Overall security posture is **Good** with one critical issue: missing authorization check in `deleteComment`. All other actions follow secure patterns.

## Critical Issues

| Issue | Location | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Missing auth check | comments.ts:45 | Critical | `deleteComment` has no session verification |
| ILIKE injection | posts.ts:112 | High | Search query not escaped |

## Improvements

| Issue | Location | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Rate limiting | auth.ts:23 | Medium | Consider stricter limits for password reset |
| Error logging | categories.ts:78 | Low | Add structured logging context |

## Best Practices

- All actions use Zod validation
- Proper ownership checks in post mutations
- Structured error responses
- revalidatePath used consistently

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Add auth check to `deleteComment`
2. **Before merge**: Escape ILIKE wildcards in search
3. **Future**: Implement rate limiting for sensitive actions
```

## Severity Definitions

| Level | Impact | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerability, data loss risk | Block merge |
| **High** | Significant bug, security gap | Fix before merge |
| **Medium** | Performance issue, maintainability | Fix recommended |
| **Low** | Style issue, minor improvement | Track for later |
