## Findings
{Updated as research progresses}

## Conclusion
{Final recommendation or decision}

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create ADR if decision needed
- [ ] Create Knowledge if pattern confirmed
- [ ] Create Issue if action needed
```

## Usage Flow

```
Research (investigation)
    ↓
ADR (if decision needed)

Knowledge (confirmed pattern)

## Integration with Issues/Projects

Discussions can be added to Projects:
```bash
gh project item-add PROJECT_ID --url DISCUSSION_URL
```

Cross-reference in Issues:
```markdown
See Discussion #30 for background research.
```

## Notes

- Discussions use same number space as Issues (#1, #2, ...)
- Cross-references work: "See #30" links to Discussion or Issue
- Projects can track both Issues and Discussions
